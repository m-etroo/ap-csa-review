# Unit 1: Primitive Types

Primitives can be differentiated from objects because primitives always begin with a lowercase letter.

## Number Primitives

* **int**: Stores integers from `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`. These values are accessible through `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE` respectively.
* **double**: Placeholder

## Other Primitives

* **boolean**: Either `true` or `false`

## Comparing Primitives

Primitive variables should be compared using traditional operators (!=, ==, etc.). It is not possible to use `equals()` (or any methods at all) with primitive types.
