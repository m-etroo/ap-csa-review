# Contributing

It is possible that there may still remain large gaps of information in this guide. Therefore, contributions are certainly welcome to improve the volume and quality of information.

Please open a pull request with any changes you'd like to make. Changes should adhere to the existing general file structure and pass [`markdownlint`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint). (There is an Actions workflow to check this.)

If you are not familiar with Git but still want to add something, feel free to check out the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).
