# Exam Preparation & Taking the Exam

This page offers some advice as to some possibilities for preparing for the AP Computer Science A exam. This is largely based on personal opinion.

## Exam preparation in general – start here

Here are some things you may want to consider doing to prepare for the AP Exam:

* Do everything listed in ["Navigating this guide"](#navigating-this-guide) section.

* Read through the ["General exam tips"](#general-exam-tips) section.

* [Practice. the. FRQs.](../resources.md#frq) A good way to do this would be to choose a past FRQ, complete it, compare your solution to the canonical solution in the Scoring Guidelines, and score it with the Scoring Guidelines.
  * You can also "check" your score by viewing one of the sample responses, scoring it yourself, and comparing your score to the official score.

* Familiarize yourself with the [task verbs used on the exam](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam-tips) so you know what you're doing when writing FRQ responses. There are only three, and they are basically common sense.

## Navigating this guide

General suggestions for anyone, regardless of level of comfort with the course content:

* Read through:
  * This page – to see what you might want to look over
  * The ["about the exam"](about_the_exam.md) page – to know what to expect

* Read through the [topic list](topic_list.md). This is a full list of pretty much every topic assessed on the AP Exam. By running through this list, you can see what individual topics you may need to review.

* Read the ["gotchas"](gotchas.md) page. Even if you are confident about the course content, you may have overlooked/forgotten some of the things listed here, which may trip you up on the exam.

* Check out the [resources](../resources.md) page and consider looking at anything that piques your interest or might be helpful.

If you are having trouble with a particular unit or units, you probably want to look back at any class resources for those topics or the unit pages in this guide, if they are complete.

## General exam tips

An assortment of pointers based on College Board publications, common sense, and other sources.

### Before the exam

The usual – start studying early, go to bed early, and eat breakfast.

### Free-Response Questions

* Read through the full question and specification before writing anything. If you are well-prepared, you will have the time, and it will be much better than if you make a mistake and need to restart/reorganize your code.

* Don't use methods, constructs, or other material that is not covered in the CED or listed on the Java Quick Reference. It may hurt your score if you are not fully familiar with what you are doing.

* Leave space in between lines of code in your solution in case you need to add something later.
