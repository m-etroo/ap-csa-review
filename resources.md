# Study Resources

There is a large wealth of resources available to assist in preparation for the AP Computer Science A exam.

In no particular order, some of them are listed here:

* [Course and Exam Description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a): This is the core document for the AP CSA course, and this review guide is largely based off of this since it provides a listing of all the essential knowledge assessed on the AP Exam.
  * The CED has a lot of useful resources, including practice multiple-choice questions.

* [AP CSA Java Quick Reference](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a): This Quick Reference sheet will be provided to exam-takers for **both** the MCQ and FRQ sections of the AP Exam.

* [Released Free-Response Questions, 2021](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam?course=ap-computer-science-a)
  * This page also has some supplemental materials relating to these questions, including the official Scoring Guidelines used to assess student responses.

* [Released Free-Response Questions, 1999-2020](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam/past-exam-questions?course=ap-computer-science-a): These are all of the publicly-available Free-Response Questions from past AP Exams.
  * Note that several of these questions from AP Exams prior to 2019 refer to *interfaces*, which is a topic that is no longer assessed on the AP Exam.
  * The same supplemental materials as in the 2021 FRQs are available here too.
  * A table of all of these questions and the free-response categories they fit into is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BLqUERJzT3ghbRkqqHr0a6V4j4kXuvKc/view?usp=sharing) (this table was provided in the 2021 AP Live Review Sessions).
